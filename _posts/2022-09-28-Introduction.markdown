This blog is an exercise for me as a web developer. I wanted to use github since I've had some experience with it but mostly I wanted to put together 
everything I've learned with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby and Jekyll - which is what this theme is written on.
<br/> <br/>
As the title says, this is just an introduction and I intend to use this blog as a small place to tell new things I've learn and explain cool things I've made.
<br/> <br/>
This site is available in English and Portuguese. All posts wil be written in both languages. The site also features a dark and light theme
that can be toggled in the left corner.
<br/> <br/>
Enjoy your stay here and good reading.
